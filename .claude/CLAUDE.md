2. **Lint:** `bun run lint` — zero errors
3. **Typecheck:** `bun run typecheck` — no TypeScript errors
4. **Commit:** all changes committed to your branch (overstory/builder-supervisor-test/overstory-ow1m)
5. **Signal completion:** send `worker_done` mail to lead-tests-1: `overstory mail send --to lead-tests-1 --subject "Worker done: overstory-ow1m" --body "Quality gates passed." --type worker_done --agent builder-supervisor-test`

- Commit only to your branch: overstory/builder-supervisor-test/overstory-ow1m
- Never push to the canonical branch
- Report completion via `bd close` AND `overstory mail send --type result`
- If you encounter a blocking issue, send mail with `--priority urgent --type error`
